# Creating a website to store recipes!

## Start of project:
This is going to be a very simple website where I store all of my favorite recipes and write how to make them.

## End of project:
This website was a lot of fun!. I reinforced what I already knew and I learned a lot more about Git in the process! I hope to learn more!
